#CHESS
I didn't programmed almost anything in C in the last 2 years, and currently I'm trying to go back to learning C, so I just started to read "The C Programming Language", and, to put in practice the language, I'm going to delevop a Chess game in C.
GCC command: "gcc chess.c -o chess -lallegro -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_image && ./chess"
